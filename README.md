# üîóBrowser Wizard

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is currently unfit for production at this time so implement at your own risk.

# üîóPurpose

This purpose of this project is to intuitively change the way us webscrapers scrape websites with various Anti-Bot protections.

# Usage

Browser Wizard provides powerful capabilities for intercepting and modifying network requests, as well as ensuring network stability during web scraping operations.

## Request Hijacking

The `/examples/hijack.go` file demonstrates how to intercept and modify network requests:

### Basic Request Interception

```go
// Enable network interception
b.SendCommandWithoutResponse("Network.setRequestInterception", map[string]interface{}{
    "patterns": []map[string]interface{}{{"urlPattern": "*"}},
})

// Listen for intercepted requests
go func() {
    for {
        event := b.Listen()
        if event.Method == "Network.requestWillBeSent" {
            // Handle intercepted request
        }
    }
}()
```

### Modifying Requests

You can modify request headers and continue the intercepted request:

```go
if event.Method == "Network.requestIntercepted" {
    reqID := event.Params["interceptionId"].(string)
    headers := map[string]interface{}{
        "X-My-Header": "ModifiedByHijack",
    }
    b.SendCommandWithoutResponse("Network.continueInterceptedRequest", map[string]interface{}{
        "interceptionId": reqID,
        "headers":        headers,
    })
}
```

## Network Stability

The `/examples/stability.go` file shows how to wait for network stability before proceeding:

### Wait for Network Stability

```go
func WaitForNetworkStability(b *browser.Browser) error {
    // Monitor network activity and wait for stability
    // Returns when network activity has been stable for 1.5 seconds
}
```

This is particularly useful for sites with dynamic content loading or anti-bot protections that make multiple requests.

## Basic Setup

```go
chromePath, chromeInstalled := launcher.LookPath()
if !chromeInstalled {
    return fmt.Errorf("Chrome not found in PATH")
}

// Initialize browser
b := browser.GreenLight(chromePath, false, "https://example.com")

// Enable network monitoring
b.SendCommandWithoutResponse("Network.enable", nil)

// Create page and navigate
page := b.NewPage()
page.Goto("https://example.com")

// Wait for stability or add delays as needed
page.YellowLight(5000)

// Clean up
b.RedLight()
```

# THIS IS A FORK
